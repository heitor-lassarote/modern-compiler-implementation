-- c.
-- I won't demonstrate (too lazy), but...
-- (a) will insert "t", "s", "p", and "i" normally, with "s" to the left of "t",
-- then "p" to the left of "t" and "s", and "i" to the left of "t", "s" and "p".
-- The next "p" will have no effect as it exists, and the tree is returned
-- unchanged. "f" and "b" are finally inserted, "f" to the left of everything,
-- and then "b" to the left of again everything. The tree remains unchanged for
-- "s" and "t" inserted next. The conclusion is that everything is always
-- inserted left, and the tree is unbalanced.
-- (b) will keep inserting on the right, so it behaves like a linked list and it
-- has O(n) for lookup. This is because after "a" is inserted, and "b" is
-- inserted as well, "b" will be greater, so to the right of "a". With "c", it
-- will be inserted to the right of both "a" and "b", and so on. Notice that in
-- this case, insertion is O(nÂ²).
